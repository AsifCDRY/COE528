# COE528---Object-Oriented-Analysis-and-Design

This repository contains some projects done in this course (Object Oriented Analysis and Design).

The most notable project is the Bookstore App, as it was the final project of this course and the culmination of all that I have learned.
For a general summary, the bookstore app allows a customer to select and purchase books from a list using either money or points. 
Points are rewarded to customers based on how many books they buy.
There is also an admin who adds books and customers to the app.
Customer and book information are stored in separate text files which is read by the program.
The GUI for the app was made through JavaFX.
